### `git get-in-prog-cmd`

If is currently rebasing, merging, cherry-picking or reverting, outputs `rebase`, `merge`, `cherry-pick` or `revert` respectively.
If not, exit with error, and output "Not currently rebasing, merging or cherry-picking" to `stderr`.
<br>_(Used to infer the continue/abort/etc. commands for rebasing/merging/cherry-picking/etc)_

```bash
# Alias for:
if git is-rebasing; then
    echo rebase
elif git is-merging; then
    echo merge
elif git is-cherry-picking; then
    echo cherry-pick
elif git is-reverting; then
    echo revert
else
    >&2 echo "Not currently rebasing, merging, cherry-picking nor reverting"
    exit 1
fi
```
